# Git-Finder
Git Finder is a Django web app enabling users to discover GitHub users by city. Users input a city name, triggering the app to retrieve a list of GitHub users associated with that location. Leveraging Django for backend development, the app integrates with the GitHub API to fetch user data efficiently.
